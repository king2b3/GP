### Next things to consider

1. Max size of new code
2. Exhaustive testing of mutations, on every node
3. Prepare the full test case test pattern


### Things to fix

1. Exhaustive testing function change needed
2. Decrease in diversity metric even more? Just keeps adding gates every epoch
3. Check out remove node, (I think its working fine now)
