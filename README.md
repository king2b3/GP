## Genetic Programming Framework
### Bayley King - king2b3@mail.uc.edu

Genetic Programming Framework (better name soon to come) using the HereBOY algorithm[[1]](#1).

This is a custom framework that we developed in Python 3.7, which will produce a evolved variant of a verilog/vhdl file through means of an evolutionary algorithm. 

### Installation

    cd && git clone https://github.com/king2b3/GP.git

There other dependencies for the library are varying, and will be updated as needed.

## Usage
The file main.py acts as controller for the network, and can use arg parsing to control parameters.

## Coming Soon
An official release is coming soon, with files available to allow for re-running of the results in the publication.
